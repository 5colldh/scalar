Scalar Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Scalar is a PHP and MySQL application built with CodeIgniter.
 
* Note that mod_rewrite (.htaccess) must be enabled in Apache config.
* Scalar creates new folders and writes files in the Scalar root folder. Please make sure that the root folder is writable by the web server and PHP.

1) 

Run the SQL script on a fresh MySQL database (e.g., "scalar_store"):

system/application/config/scalar_store.sql

Note that five additional tables will be added after Scalar's first use.

Update database fields (hostname, database, username and password) at:

system/application/config/database.php

2)

Add a new salt string, reCAPTCHA key (for you domain, http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha), 
registration key, SoundCloud key, and a few other keys:

system/application/config/local_settings.php

Add session encryption key ($config['encryption_key']) and cookie/sesion variable ($config['cookie_prefix'] = "";) at:

system/application/config/config.php

3) 

By default, the home page (book index) will display "Scalar" as the page title; this can be updated at:

system/application/language/en/content_lang.php

4) 

All should be set to visit your site at its URL and see a basic home page with the Scalar title at left and login at right.

If you experience MySQL connection problems (say, there was a typo in the the connection parameters), correct, then refresh your page,
you might notice an error from Session.php involving num_rows().  In this case, clear your browser cache & cookies and refresh.

5) 

You can register your new account using the 'register' link.

To make your user (after it is register) a "super admin", requires direct access to MySQL (e.g., phpMyAdmin). In the database table
"scalar_store_users" edit your user row then set the "is_super" bit to 1. After refreshing Scalar, you will have access to all
Scalar books and additional admin tabs in the "Dashboard" area

Note that even super admins can't save changes to others' books unless they are explicitly provided "author" privilege in
the "Users" tab of the book's "Dashboard" area.

Enjoy!

Updates we've made to incorporated libraries, kept here for reference if they need updating

ARC2:
1) ARC2_Resource.php->getProps(): commented out "if (!isset($this->index[$s])) $this->fetchData($s);"
2) ARC2_RDFJSONSerializer.php->jsonEscape(): replaced "return trim(json_encode($v), '"');" with return substr(json_encode($v), 1, -1);
In the GitHub distro, #2 is corrected

Froogaloop:
1) Changed $f=g to froogaloop=g
